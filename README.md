# Spring Boot with Spring Web Flow and JSP
Starter Spring Boot project with Spring Web Flow and JSP configured.

This work is inspired by [this repository about Spring Boot with Spring Web Flow and Thymeleaf](https://github.com/vakho10/Java-Spring-Boot-with-Web-Flow-and-Thymeleaf) and a bit of help comes from the [Guide to Spring Webflow from Baeldung](https://github.com/eugenp/tutorials/tree/master/spring-web-modules/spring-mvc-webflow).

Sadly, you won't find a Spring Boot starter configured with Spring Web Flow. As said in [this issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/502), because of a lack of interest, a starter for this purpose is not present, for the moment (this discussion began in March 2014).

# Understanding Spring Web Flow

My understanding of Spring Web Flow has been raised by the series of course of [Khozema Nullwala](https://www.youtube.com/c/KhozemaNullwala/featured), especially the ones which begin with `Part 06`. You can find a playlist of this series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrQmoj_VxOrgxyXvN0ZPWdmZ7k5jU5W63).

Khozema Nullwala also provided his tutorial project in [this repository](https://github.com/khozema-nullwala/online-shopping).
